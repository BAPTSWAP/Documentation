## Getting Set Up for Trading

### Requirements

1. **Aptos-Compatible Wallet**: Before trading, ensure you have an Aptos-compatible wallet. Learn how to get one [here](../../../get-started-on-aptos/create-a-wallet.md).&#x20;
2. **APT Tokens**: You'll also need APT tokens for trading. Instructions for acquiring APT tokens are available [here](../../../get-started-on-aptos/get-aptos-coins.md).

## Trading Process

### Accessing the Exchange

1. Navigate to the Baptswap exchange [here](https://baptswap.com/swap).
2. Unlock your wallet by selecting "Connect" in the top-right corner. If you haven't connected your wallet yet, follow this [guide](../../../get-started-on-aptos/connect-your-wallet-to-baptswap.md).

### Executing a Trade

1. **Select 'From' Token**: Choose the token you wish to trade from the dropdown in the "From" section. Ensure you have a sufficient balance, which is displayed above the dropdown.
2. **Select 'To' Token**: In the "To" section, choose the token you want to receive. Enter the amount in the input box, and the corresponding "From" amount will be estimated automatically.
3. **Initiate Swap**: Verify the details and click "Swap".
4. **Confirm Details**: Review the information in the pop-up window and click "Confirm Swap". Your wallet will prompt you for final confirmation.
5. **Completion**: Once confirmed, you can view the transaction on the Aptos Explorer.

## Troubleshooting

### Why Isn't My Transaction Going Through?

#### Gas Fees

Ensure you have sufficient APT for gas fees, which fluctuate based on network traffic. Learn more about [gas fee here](https://aptos.dev/concepts/gas-txn-fee/).&#x20;

#### Transaction Fees

Check if the tokens you're swapping have any fees or restrictions. Tokens on Baptswap may include a transaction fee in their contracts for various purposes, such as funding a treasury or rewarding stakers.

### Swapping with Transaction Fees

Research tokens beforehand to understand any transaction fee mechanisms. Adjust your slippage settings to accommodate these fees. For example, a 5% transaction fee may require a slippage setting of at least 6%-7%.

## Conclusion

By following these steps and being aware of token-specific fees and restrictions, you can enjoy a smooth trading experience on Baptswap. Always stay informed about the tokens you trade to ensure successful transactions.
