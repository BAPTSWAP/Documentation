{% hint style="warning" %}
This page requires the reader to be familiar with the Fee-on-Transfer concept. Before reading, make sure to check out the [Fee-on-Transfer introduction](fee-on-transfer/).

For all tokens that have Reward Fees enabled through Baptswap's Fee-on-Transfer support, their holders will be able to enjoy an extra way of growing their balance through the Rewards Pools.

Each pair including a Reward Token, will have its own designated Rewards Pool. A Rewards Pool will give rewards to stakers, in both assets in the staked pair.&#x20;

### Scenario 1: One Token in Pair With Rewards

> A Moon Token, $MOON, is paired with $APT into a MOON-APT LP pair.&#x20;
>
> The $MOON team enables Rewards Fees for the token.
>
> A new Rewards Pool is created for this pair, where holders of $MOON now can stake in a MOON/APT pool.
>
> For every time a user swaps $APT into $MOON, the Rewards Fees collect $MOON and send the fees to the Rewards Pool.
>
> For every time a user swaps $MOON into $APT, the Rewards Fees collect $APT and send the fees to the Rewards Pool.
>
> Stakers in the MOON/APT pool will therefore earn rewards in both $MOON and $APT in this pool.

### Scenario 2: Both Tokens in Pair With Rewards

> A Moon Token, $MOON, is paired with $STAR into a MOON-STAR LP pair.&#x20;
>
> The $MOON team enables Rewards Fees for the token.
>
> The $STAR team enables Rewards Fees for the token, .
>
> A new Rewards Pool is created for this pair, where holders of $MOON now can stake in a MOON/APT pool.
>
> For every time a user swaps $APT into $MOON, the Rewards Fees collect $MOON and send the fees to the Rewards Pool.
>
> For every time a user swaps $MOON into $APT, the Rewards Fees collect $APT and send the fees to the Rewards Pool.
>
> Stakers in the MOON/APT pool will therefore earn rewards in both $MOON and $APT in this pool.

If the team of $MOON enables Rewards Fees, a MOON-APT Rewards Pool is created. Here, holders of $MOON can stake their tokens, to earn rewards every time a swap between $MOON and $APT



Every team of a token trading on Baptswap, have the option to enable Rewards Fees for their own token. For tokens with such Fees enabled, a rewards pool is created for each LP pair the token is paired up with. Holders of tokens with Rewards Fees will through the Rewards Pools, be able to stake their held tokens, and receive rewards based on the pair's trading volume.

For every transaction between a pair, where one or both of the tokens in the pair have Rewards Fees enabled
