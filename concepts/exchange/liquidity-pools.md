# Liquidity Pools

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/LiqPools.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Liquidity pool tokens (sometimes known as liquidity provider tokens) are given to users who provide liquidity in liquidity pools. These tokens act as a receipt, allowing you to claim your original stake and interest earned.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited **BAPT** and **APT** into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive **BAPT-APT LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the BAPT-APT Liquidity Pool.&#x20;

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.&#x20;

Whenever someone trades on Baptswap, the trader pays a 0.90% fee, **of which 0.30%** is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 BAPT and 10 APT tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 BAPT + 1 APT
* Someone trades 10 BAPT for 10 APT.
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 BAPT.
* The BAPT/APT liquidity pool now has 10.030 BAPT and 10.030 APT.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00030 BAPT + 1.00030 APT.

## "The Best Way to Earn on Baptswap"

Providing LP to popular pairs is proven to be one of the methods with the highest APR. Like explained above, LP providers will earn a portion of the trading volume from the trading fees. But on BAPTSWAP, there are even more juice to it.

Since tokens with liquidity on Baptswap have the option to implement LP Fees to their tokens through Baptswap's unique Fee-on-Transfer solution, LP providers can earn even more, in addition to the 0.3% on each trade!

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual tokens are allowed to add up to 15% going to the LP from the token's trading volume. These fees gets distributed among all providers, just like the 0.3% exchange fee!

Tokens with LP fees implemented can reach up to 76.5x greater value to provide LP on these tokens, compared to other exchanges!
{% endhint %}

## Benefits for Providing LP

Having LP on the exchange is necessary for it to be possible to trade between assets.

You can only swap tokens on Baptswap if there is enough liquidity for those tokens. If nobody has added much liquidity for the token or tokens you want to swap, it will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.

Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use. The higher the trading fees, the higher rewards you will earn!

By Providing LP, the liquidity pool of the tokens gets thicker, making the assets more stable and sustainable from price impact.

These are the things that LP providers will generate their APR from:

* The asset being traded and collecting 0.3% from each trade of the pair.
* If the traded token has taxes towards LP through Baptswap's unique Fee-on-Transfer solution, the trading volume will also allocate this towards all LP providers.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.
