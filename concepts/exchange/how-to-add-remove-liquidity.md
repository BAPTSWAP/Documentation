# How to Add/Remove Liquidity

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/HowToAddRemoveLP.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Like most decentralized exchanges, Liquidity is central to how Baptswap's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page (For now, only BAPT/APT).

In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair, and receive more LP Tokens!

### **Adding liquidity**

To provide liquidity, youâ€™ll need to commit an amount of any token pair you like. Your lowest value (in USD) of the two tokens will be the limit to the liquidity you can provide.

You can easily trade for any tokens you need. Visit our How to Trade on Baptswap guide if you need to.

In this example, we will add liquidity using BAPT and APT.
