# Token Swaps

[**Token swaps**](https://baptswap.com/swap) on Baptswap are simple ways to trade one Aptos token for another via automated liquidity pools.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.9% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.3%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.6%** - Sent to the Baptswap Treasury, which includes BAPT buybacks.
