# Governance

BAPT is required to vote and decide on the outcome of proposals through the coming Baptswap Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Baptswap will transition to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model once necessary governance frameworks are in place.

Holders may initiate proposals, vote on issues, and propose potential changes in protocol parameters - playing a key role in shaping the direction of the protocol.&#x20;
